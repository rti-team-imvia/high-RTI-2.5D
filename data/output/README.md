# Output Data Format and Interpretation

This directory contains files generated by the depth-to-volume processing pipeline.

## Main Output Files

- **reconstructed_mesh.obj**: 3D mesh created from the input depth map
- **reconstructed_mesh.ply**: Alternative mesh format with vertex colors (if available)
- **reconstructed_mesh_points.ply**: Point cloud used to generate the mesh

## Visualization Files

The `visualizations/` subdirectory contains:

- **mesh_visualization.png**: Rendered view of the 3D mesh
- **point_cloud_visualization.png**: Visualization of the point cloud
- **camera_and_points.png**: Debug view showing camera-point spatial relationship

## Interpretation

- The OBJ/PLY files can be opened in any 3D modeling software (Blender, MeshLab, etc.)
- Mesh quality depends on input depth map quality and camera parameters
- Scale is preserved in metric units (meters)
- Z-axis typically points away from the camera, Y-axis upward, X-axis to the right

## Common Visualization Software

- **MeshLab**: Open source for viewing and processing 3D meshes
- **Blender**: Full 3D creation suite with advanced rendering
- **CloudCompare**: Specialized in point cloud and mesh analysis
