# Output data format and interpretation

This directory contains the output generated by the depth-to-volume processing pipeline. The output files represent the 2.5D volumetric representation created from the input depth map.

## Output Files

1. **Volume Representation**: The primary output is a volumetric representation of the scene derived from the depth map. This representation can be in various formats such as:
   - 3D mesh files (e.g., .obj, .ply)
   - Volume data files (e.g., .raw, .vox)

2. **Visualization Files**: Additional files may be generated for visualization purposes, which can include:
   - Depth maps visualized as images (e.g., .png, .jpg)
   - Rendered views of the volumetric representation

## Interpreting the Output

- **3D Mesh Files**: These files can be imported into 3D modeling software for further manipulation or rendering. The mesh represents the surface of the objects in the scene based on the depth information.

- **Volume Data Files**: These files contain the volumetric data that can be used for simulations or further processing in scientific applications.

- **Visualization Images**: The visualized depth maps provide a quick reference to understand the depth information extracted from the original image.

## Usage

To utilize the output files, you can:
- Load the 3D mesh into a 3D viewer or modeling software.
- Use the volume data in applications that support volumetric rendering.
- Analyze the visualized depth maps for quality assurance or further processing.

For more detailed instructions on how to work with these output files, please refer to the documentation of the respective software you are using.
